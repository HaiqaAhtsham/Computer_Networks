This project optimizes IP allocation with VLSM and efficient routing through OSPF, RIP, and EIGRP. DHCP and redistribution enhance IP assignment, while NAT secures the G network. VLANs, managed by the 3560 switch as a VTP server, incorporate security measures, ensuring a streamlined, scalable, and secure network.
